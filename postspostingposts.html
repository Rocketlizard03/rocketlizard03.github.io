    1951 Marked the beginning of the first truly scientific expeditions to antarctica and the subsequent discovery of the lost continent.
    On that continent many native tribes existed completely untouched by the outside world, living in almost neolithic conditions with minimal technological advancement.
    However, once our explorers set foot on the continent, the tribed began to adopt and even outpace the technology available at the time. By 1952 they had invented the 
    micron level transistor, by 1954 they had put a man on the moon, by 1960, they may as well have been extra terrestrials. However while their pursuit
    of technology was completely peaceful, the governements of the world had deemed them a threat to the natural order of things. And so collaboration between all
    major states at the time brought the nuclear end to the lost continent. Furthermore, almost every single tribal living on the lost continent was eradicated from the face of the earth.
    Their culture, nor their technological advancement never to be studied again, until now. Project Divulge seeks to revive the ability for technological advancement
    that drove these tribesmen into golden eras never before seen in history, and through repeated simulation of these events, we may soon uncover the secret to their success.
